# Data-Base-Project

This repository contains the code for a gaming cafe management system. The software is designed to meet the client's requirements for a user-friendly interface, customer database management, and earning summaries. Additionally, an optional feature of timer-based computer access is included.

## Client's Requirements

1. Good GUI Design: The client wants a user-friendly interface design that strikes a balance between simplicity and complexity.
2. Database for Customer Management: The software should include a database to manage customer information, such as Name, Number, login name, login password, money spent, the money the customer paid, and their debt.
3. Summary of Earnings: The system should provide daily, weekly, and monthly summaries of the cafe's earnings.

Optional Feature:
- Timer-based Computer Access: The option to open computers with a timer without creating new customer profiles may be useful for younger customers.
